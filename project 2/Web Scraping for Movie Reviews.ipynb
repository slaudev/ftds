      "[\"This is what Hollywood needs. A great story with a great director/producer. After that the best thing a studio can do is get the hell out of the way and let artists create art.Dune Part 2 is creative, beautiful, tragic, and mesmerizing. Never once did I get bored or anticipate what was going to happen next. I haven't read the book so I have nothing to compare it to.Denis Villeneuve continues to amaze me with the effort he puts into each of his films. The acting in this film was top notch too. We saw it in IMAX and the sound was earth shattering. If you're gonna see this movie, see it on the largest screen possible.\", \"Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.Extremely recommended.\", 'Phenomenal stuff. I\\'ll probably calm down tomorrow but right now my heart\\'s beating like crazy and my brain\\'s screaming it\\'s a bloody masterpiece. This is one of the few movies that I didn\\'t try to control my expectations beforehand and it still surpassed them in many ways.\"Power over spice is power over all\"- that kinda turned out to be a lie at the end. As The movie starts, I felt an immediate sense of tension through its score. It\\'s a cinematic experience; I can\\'t imagine feeling the same lying at home in bed, watching in headphones. The resonating vibrations as the sounds reverberate through the theater created an epic atmosphere.When Part One came out people said it was \"game of thrones in space\", I wasn\\'t really taken by that as much, especially since people said the same about Apple TV\\'s Foundation series. So I just enjoyed the movie as Dune and bore no comparisons. After watching part two however I see it; the world building, the politics, the epic grandeur of it all.However, the first half of Dune Part Two is pretty grounded and calm, delving into the lives of the Fremen. It almost feels like two distinct movies, the first half intricately setting the stage for the climactic third act and reinforcing character connections established in Dune Part One. Unlike the Part One\\'s focus on lore, this movie is more devotion-driven, also resembling a political narrative, especially knowing of the hidden puppeteers behind the empire. The result appears to be an intricate web of schemes involving the empire, the witch-advisor women(can\\'t spell their names lol), and the Baron\\'s family. Despite the emperor\\'s pulling the strings, the Baron\\'s family still felt like main antagonist to me.The second half of the movie is where we see the epic scale of dune. The movies not quick paced but you couldn\\'t tell, I was absolutely immersed in it.I absolutely loved the kind \"The mahdi is too humble to say he is the mahdi.\" Theatre burst out in laughter. It felt weird, I wasn\\'t expecting any humour. It\\'s funnier than I expected. More lively than the first Dune movie. I\\'d already seen the Usul-worm-riding scene from the Dune Part One reopening bonus content. I was still just as excited and it didn\\'t spoil a thing.The visual brilliance, as expected was stunning, elevating every aspect. The authenticity of the scenes made it feel as if characters were immersed in the environment, rather than merely placed against a green screen. I loved the portrayal of time passing through Paul\\'s changing eyes; the longer he stays the bluer his eyes get. Despite how lively it is, the plot, while progressing at a measured pace, remains engaging, drawing attention away from its deliberate slowness. It has much more action, the battles were absolutely epic, I feel like they could have been longer but they still captivated me.Jessica disappears for a while, but just when I thought that, she showed up. Other than Paul and Zendeya, the rest of the cast doesn\\'t really get as much screen time as you\\'d think. I loved the baby/embryo/featus scenes. Batista with no mask in the desert while his whole team\\'s suited up was badass. I love him in darker roles, although I think some moments felt overly animated. But it gave an effective contrast to Austin Butler though, I couldn\\'t wait to see what his character was like. Very fierce, intimidating and psycho. The girl shivering with the plate in her hands before the gladiator games made me chuckle. Butler did also sound like the baron at times.Dune: Part Two stands steady on its own, it felt complete compared to the more introductory feel of Part One. Despite this, I still felt like it lays groundwork for Dune: Part Three/Messiah, leaving a sense of setup. The movie, while feeling like a precursor, still manages to provide a more conclusive ending. I also think you should watch Part One first, if that has to be said; and the prospect of a back-to-back viewing sounds like a fun afternoon.One thing I can complain about is Stilger. I have mixed feelings. In Part One, Javier was fierce and was my favorite character, in this movie though he\\'s depicted as a religious fanatic for the most part. It was done well, but I still miss the Stilgar who walked up to Duke Leto Atreides with no disregard. This felt like a different person, still fierce, just different.Loved Austin butler though, I wasn\\'t sure what to expect as I tried my best to avoid trailers and teasers apart from the Dune part one bonus content. That short lady in charge of extracting \\'the water of life\\' had some insane calves on her, I\\'m extremely jealous.While I was initially not convinced about Timothée Chalamet as the lead, he truly owns the role in the sequel, displayed acting facets I\\'d not seen before from him. The movie essentially unfolds as Paul Atreides\\' coming-of-age story, with Zendaya delivering an amazing performance. The first act, focusing on their love story, adds depth to the events at the movie\\'s end. Zendaya\\'s portrayal transcends the typical love story, I hope her role extends into Dune: Messiah, and hopefully adds further complexity to her character.We see Paul undergo some transformations. From being the son of royalty to experiencing love, the narrative takes a surprising turn when he assumes authority in the third act. Although I liked it, it felt a bit rushed. But, I found solace/logic with the \"water of life\" spiritual poison, where drinking it resulted in a profound shift in your personality. The contrast between the before and after versions of Paul, as well as Jessica, is striking so it kinda made sense to me.I think watching this movie at home won\\'t do it justice, it\\'s clearly made for the big screens if you can. It\\'s pretty epic and I think it\\'ll remain memorable as one of 2024\\'s best movies, despite only being February. I absolutely loved it.', 'I\\'m going to write this as a review for both Dune movies, so I\\'ll include my thoughts about Dune part one throughout. For me, the most difficult part about rating these movies is trying to judge them as they stand on their own without comparing them to the original book.As movies, I think both are great: the cinematography is amazing, the sound design is good, the acting is good, I liked the visual style and how they interpreted the various technologies of the world of Dune. The soundtrack is good, it can be a little overbearing at times but the music in part two felt like an improvement on this from part one. One of the biggest complaints people had with both movies is the pacing, saying that the first movie was dragging and the second was rushing. I agree with the sentiments about the latter, but personally I enjoyed the slower pacing of the first Dune movie. The second movie definitely moves quickly through its first half, then it slows down a lot in the second half before rushing to its conclusion.The casting is good for the most part, I personally disagree with casting Rebecca Ferguson but I\\'ll get into that more later. In the first movie I wasn\\'t especially impressed with Timothée Chalamet as Paul but I think he does better in the role in the second part. Jason Momoa was a perfect pick for Duncan Idaho and Oscar Isaac did a great job as Duke Leto. Stellan Skarsgard was a good choice for Baron Harkonnen but I think he could have been written better. I was really looking forward to seeing Christopher Walken as the Emperor Shaddam but unfortunately he felt pretty lifeless and didn\\'t bring very much energy to the scenes he was in.Overall, as they stand on their own, the Dune movies are great films. I don\\'t know if I\\'d call them the defining sci-fi movies of the 21st century like other people are saying, but they\\'re still very good, definitely rewatchable, and I would recommend them.Now, moving on to comparing them to the books, because once you start doing that you get to the more disappointing side of these movies. One of the biggest issues with both movies, especially the second, is that they almost completely leave out the ecological message of the book. This is a book that has been used as a textbook in environmental science classes, but I guess the filmmakers decided that message wasn\\'t important enough. The Fremen are shown to be working towards terraforming Dune into a green world, slowly but surely making wind traps and planting grasses to fix the dunes in place. It\\'s a goal that they are working towards with total commitment even though they know that it won\\'t be realized for several generations. That\\'s a powerful message that I think a lot more people need to hear nowadays, especially in reference to the issue of climate change. The movie barely mentions this goal at all, which I think is a disservice to the original story, and it diminishes the Fremen as characters.I think the fundamental issue that these movies have with their adaptations is an understandable one, but that it could\\'ve been solved in a better way. The main issue with adapting the book is that the characters are very difficult to relate to: most of them are superhumans who have insane abilities. For the movies, a lot of the main characters are altered to make them more relatable to the audience, which is an understandable change. For some characters, this greatly improves them from the book, such as Duncan Idaho and Duke Leto. For others, like Chani and Jessica, it reduces the strength of their characters, which I\\'ll explain more later.Additionally, the book has a lot of complex concepts and story plots that it never stops to fully explain to the reader, you\\'re just supposed to pick it up as you go along and reread it to understand, making it a little obtuse. Dune is very dialogue-heavy, with a lot of the action happening in the background or only described briefly. To remedy this, the movies remove some of the more complex topics and add more action scenes, which are exciting and well choreographed, but in the second movie they start feeling repetitive and redundant, and they overpower the more intricate plot points.While the first movie cleverly managed to insert a lot of exposition without feeling like it was constantly lore dumping, part two feels like it\\'s more afraid to explain things than the first, possibly because of complaints that \"nothing happened\" in the first movie. The result of this is that the second movie is much more action-heavy, but it still wants to include the complex topics from the book, so what we get is a bunch of action sequences with scenes of political complexities strung in between them, but without the full explanations necessary to clarify them. It\\'s easy to understand why people who haven\\'t read the books would feel confused by this, the movie barely takes the time to explain what\\'s happening before it\\'s moving on to the next scene of Fremen blowing up spice haulers.Getting into direct comparisons to the book now, and starting with the first movie: my two biggest issues with the first movie was how they changed Jessica and how they dumbed down the mentats. Starting with mentats, they are a hugely important part of all of the Dune books; Thufir Hawat is essentially a main character in the first book, and Peter de Vries is a terrifying mastermind behind the Harkonnen plans. Part of what triggers Paul\\'s first vision of the coming Jihad in his name is that his mother tells him he was trained as a mentat from birth without his knowledge. In the movie, the word mentat is never said once; Paul\\'s mentat training isn\\'t brought up; Thufir Hawat is just a guy who rolls his eyes back in his head, says something smart and then disappears at the halfway mark; and Peter de Vries dies of poisoning. How disappointing.But what I think is the worse change that they made from the book is how they changed Jessica\\'s character. While the Dune books get much more feminist as they go on, the first book has very few female characters. However, Jessica makes for a very strong main character: she has complete control over her mind and body, and through her Bene Gesserit training she has almost superhuman strength, speed, and can control others with the Voice. Her internal monologue also shows that she\\'s almost always two steps ahead of everyone except Paul. In the movies, Jessica feels much weaker. In the first movie she\\'s almost always crying or on the verge of tears, which makes it a lot believable when she starts killing Harkonnens with her bear hands, and it makes the scene in the tent when Paul gets his vision (the only part of the book where Jessica openly grieves) much less powerful.Moving on to the second movie is where the changes get more disappointing. The movie begins with Paul, Jessica and the Fremen fighting the Harkonnens in some battle between the fight with Jamis and them getting to Sietch Tabr, which wasn\\'t in the book and felt like it was added for the sake of starting with an action sequence. After the fight, Jessica throws up involuntarily --- again, as a Bene Gesserit she should have total control over her body and it doesn\\'t make sense for her to do that, even though she\\'s pregnant.Speaking of Jessica\\'s child, Alia isn\\'t really a character in this, at least not like she was in the book. I can understand this, I had no idea how they were going to handle having a toddler who walks and talks like an adult and kills a man, and they handled it by having Jessica not give birth during the movie. They also don\\'t really explain how Alia is pre-born, which is a piece of information that people who didn\\'t read the book could probably use.Once Paul and Jessica get to Sietch Tabr, things feel a lot different. The book describes the interiors of the Sietch as being covered with drapery, rugs, and cushions. There are classrooms, plastic factories, and workshops. The movie doesn\\'t show this at all: the Sietch interior is all smooth, carved stone rather than natural rock walls, there\\'s no textiles to be seen, and essentially only the water reservoir is shown. In general, the depiction of the Fremen in the movie is much worse than the book. The Fremen are a very tight-knit community where people understand each other\\'s needs so well that they don\\'t even need to communicate them out loud. When Jessica feels like she needs a coffee, a Fremen with coffee simply appears without her giving an order. In the movie the Fremen are three things: good at stabbing people, fanatic believers in Paul, or people who hate the Mahdi prophecy and don\\'t believe in Paul. In the book, this dissenting faction against Paul isn\\'t really present, and Chani definitely isn\\'t part of it. I can understand that the filmmakers probably added it to help drive home the anti-hero worship message which a lot of people missed from the book, but it could have been executed better.I also disliked how they changed Chani. In the books she very easily falls for Paul and gives him unwavering support, and I think it\\'s fine that they wanted to make that more nuanced for the movies, but I don\\'t like the way they did it. The movie wants us to think that they love each other even though it constantly shows Chani ranting against the prophecy and disagreeing with Paul\\'s actions. In the end, she leaves Paul after he agrees to marry the Emperor\\'s daughter Irulan (even though in the book he makes it clear that he is only marrying her for politics, refuses to even touch her, and has three children with Chani instead). This ending will definitely complicate things if they do go through with adapting Dune Messiah to complete the film trilogy.I\\'m running out of room to write, and most people probably won\\'t read this anyway because of the length, so I\\'ll just say again that I enjoyed the movies and think they\\'re good, but some of the changes they made, especially in part two, were disappointing and could have been executed better.', \"If you liked or loved the first one, the same will apply for this one. Personally, I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well. So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now. This is everything I love about going to the movies. Also, Hans Zimmer.For book readers, I'd say this one takes more liberties than the first, but they were changes I liked, some for the better even. For the most part, it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered. The biggest change being no time jump. Therefore, a certain character doesn't fully appear in the movie contrary to the book. Though, they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally.I know it's early in the year, but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume, Best Production Design, Best Makeup, and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress. I guess that's pretty much every category now that I've typed it out lol.\", \"As with the first film, the production was beautiful. I loved the opening scenes with the Harkonnen soldiers. The arena fight between Austin Butler and the last Atreides Robert Yuan (actors names) was fantastic. The battles with the harvesters were phenomenal.The script, however, left me a little bit disappointed. What about the Guild Navigators? And how were the worms used after they came through the pass in the mountains opened up by the atomics? There was only one sequence of the initial charge (marvelous sequence when the gunships entered) but then nothing. The Sardurkar were not given enough respect in this film. There was only one scene that showed them respect and that was when they rose up from the fallen sand and rock debris and stood their ground preparing for the oncoming onslaught instead of panicking. Other than that I felt the film should have spent more time on tactical combat scenes in what was supposed to be an epic battle at the end of the film, maybe trim time off of the other dragged out sequences in the film. The first movie did a better job with the Sardaukar, you actually feared them. The epic battle at the end of this movie was less than epic. And poor Bautista, they should not have made him act like such a wimp, should have had a more glorious fight even in retreat.As much as I like Walken, I thought he was poorly cast to be Emperor. The 1984 film had a perfect actor for the personality. This is Villeneuve's fault, he picked him.The script also fails to emphasize that Paul is the Kwisatz Haderach at the end of the movie. Paul's initial ability to vaguely see the future comes from the centuries of genetic tinkering of the women of the Ben Gesserat, but after he drinks the water of life and not only survives but develops the ability to see an individual's past, as evident by the scenes in the Fremen temple where he looks at individuals and describes their past, and more clearly sees optional future outcomes, and after he actually fulfills all of the prophecies of the Fremen, the story is true, he really is the Messiah of Arrakis, justifying the religion, and he really is the Kwisatz Haderach, a man with abilities that no other man has. But the film appears to gloss over this. Shame. He is not just some populist charismatic man blamed by the likes of Zendaya's character for (perceived) fooling anyone to follow him and falling for the appeal of power and giving up his principles, he is more than that.My critique of the first film was not enough emotion, well part 2 does a better job, especially after Paul survives the water of life and becomes the anti-hero, all hell breaks loose. And Zendaya's character being a more independent women than the 1984 film was interesting, albeit the combat skills or luck were not realistic unless you buy that the Sardaukar were that inept. Part 1 was a better drama than part 2, but part 2 has some great action sequences, besides the disappointments I mentioned earlier. Not a perfect film for this Dune 1984 admirer.\", 'This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice, just by talking about it! It is the kind of experience you had once.. but you never thought you would get again.. until this movie proves you WRONG!!This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible, already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME!!Everything in this movie was TOP notch! Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci-Fi movies, but just filmmaking in general! This was a demonstration of power, in what you can achieve with filmmaking!I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find! This will be an experience that will stick with you forever!I thought the real Blockbuster was dead.. but I was wrong! This is the cinematic experience i craved!Now I am gonna watch this movie again, and maybe again! Then I am gonna read the books!', \"A monumental piece of cinema. And combined with Part 1, we have one of the greatest adaptations in genre literature history.It's clear everyone on set was aware that they were working on something special here - because literally every single person in this production have brought their A-Game for a truly incredible technical achievement. And easily the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring.Paced to perfection, at once uniquely beautiful, thought-provoking and beyond THRILLING. Dave Bautista fights someone to the death, while hanging onto the outside of a helicopter that is being shot out of the sky - and that doesn't even reach the Top 10 action set-pieces in the film.. It just doesn't get better than this.\", \"This was a perfect sequel to Denis' part one. It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having. This film will go down as one of the best in sci-fi/fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted. Not in the longest time has a franchise, and a singular movie, captivated me in such a way. This story, these characters, this planet, Dune, lives rent-free in my mind. You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX, as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene. This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling. 10/10.\", \"I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible. See for yourself in IMAX. The characters, acting, screenplay, world building, storytelling, score, actions sequences, cinematography, and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece. Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking. The casting continuation was perfect all the way through, with great new add-ons. Timothee Chalamet is believable, raw and real as Paul Atriedes. He was flawless as the lead. Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual. Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil. Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd-Rautha, and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts.Overall, Dune: Part Two is an inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth, adventure, and destiny on a galactic scale. It's a fantastic piece of filmmaking, rarely seen in modern day cinema.\", \"As an avid movie fan I see plenty of movies, many average, many bad, a few good and once in while great. But I use the word great scarcely. Dune 2 is better than great. Oppenheimer was a great movie but I wouldn't rush back to see it a second time in the near future. Dune 2, I would see it again tomorrow. The story is on par to the Star Wars legacy, the acting, on par with Oppenheimer, the SFX better than the two movies just mentioned combined. When the movie finished (over 2 and half hours) I still wanted more. The emotional ride was like nothing I can remember from ANY movie I can remember. Best movie of the year? I don't think so, best movie of a generation is more akin to what I saw. Wish I could give it 11 stars.\", \"I have to start by saying that I absolutely loved the first movie. I wasn't familiar with the story and I went with zero expectations, only to be completely stunned by the masterful artwork that was Dune Part 1.The music, the sound, the visuals, the entire world and its atmosphere, the characters even the plot, I found everything beautifully crafted and a breath of fresh air for the Sci-Fi genre.I am not familiar with the source material so this is considering only the movies and while I had a deep desire to love this second part specially considering the reviews it has been getting and how much I loved the first one, I couldn't help but feel a slight disappointment...\\nLet's start with the positives - the cinematography is consistently out of this world, it is a visual wonder, a mix of practical effects with CGI that blends in perfectly. The intense and dramatic sound effects associated with a thrilling and daunting soundtrack delivers! And of course the acting is consistently good, this time around it was great to see Javier Barden's character being developed and bringing some great topics to the table.What makes me wonder the most to be honest is how different both the first movie and the second are being reviewed by the general public..\\nFor once its running time is considerable (almost 3 hours) and somehow it feels strangely rushed... It's a bit odd to explain but in other words, we get so many scenes that feel that don't contribute at all to the narrative and out of the blue we transition to a scene where the main character changes the demeanor entirely without much build up leading to it..\\nThe movie spends so much time trying to connect Paul to the Fremens, yet it fails to explore his own inner motivations, the moment we see his character changing, it gives you the feeling that you missed something.Paul's betrayal to Chani also feels a bit irrelevant since the chemistry built on the first movie seems to just dissipate...\\nThe relationship with his mother is also very odd and inconsistent, her character becomes dark fairly early in the movie, in one moment she is her beloved mother and without much shared screen time he then seems to almost despise her by the end of the film without the audience having a deeper understanding of their relationship dynamic.The newly introduced villains are one dimensional and having Austin Butler's character seemed pointless... there was no goal for him, he gets killed off almost instantly alongside with the Baron who got so much build from the first movie...\\nAn A list of actors like Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken and Léa Seydoux, all of them could've been amazing characters but get zero chance of showing that.An entire plot with Paul's sister goes out the drain as well... messing with time started to become promising but it leads nowhere... I mean I could go on, in short the movie had many plot gaps, didn't develop the characters properly, poorly introduced the newcomers and relied heavily on its outstanding cinematography and sound.It's a shame because I can't tell you how excited I was to write a praising review, but this was my honest opinion which apparently doesn't seem to align with the majority.A lot of scenes drag without much substance to it, the highlight of the film was Javier Barden's character and the messages behind the dangerous of the concept of a Messia.I am of course hopeful for the third movie, maybe with my expectations now lowered it becomes a great experience all over again.\", \"This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie. Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame. Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15.000 years of civilization. Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling, Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch. The pacing is irregular, at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed. Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material, you don't get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made. Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films, is probably not doing the story justice, should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work, therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely.\", \"We have waited many, many years for a movie of this caliber. I'm 59 years old, a female, grandmother and retired - this was THE. BEST. MOVIE I have ever seen. I don't tend to like si-fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor . The length of this movie wasn't even noticed by us; it wasn't long enough to be honest. We wanted MORE. It ended and we weren't done yet. We know how long it takes for sequels to come along - so who knows if I'll still be on the planet to see it. I hope I am. And I hope they can do it justice. The last time I remember a movie being THIS good: I was in high school in the 80's. DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE. CRAZY GOOD.\", '\"Dune\" has been successfully put to the big screen. Not only is this a good adaptation, it passes with flying colors.The character arc of Paul Atreides is fascinating and complex. I love how they delved into his psyche and motivations so prevalently in this movie. He is reluctant to take up the Messianic mantle because he knows it\\'s a lie. But things go according to his vision and he becomes a morally complex character. Religious fantacism takes hold of the fremen.It is up for interpretation what kind of character Paul becomes. Is he a tyrant? Was it the only path? What does religion have to do with it? Paul takes hold of the Bene Gesserit lie by exploiting faith.This leads to other questions. Can one truly trust the arm of flesh? The frailty of man? Leaders have come and gone throughout history bringing different ideals.One\\'s own morality comes into play. Agency is vital to the human experience. Man will always falter. This leads to questions of a higher power and His role. Is there a God above? What are the implications of that?We don\\'t get stories like this in Hollywood anymore. There is no happy ending in Dune, and one can only ponder the moral complexities of it. The book and movie have made me contemplate many things and I deeply appreciate stories like that.Others have already applauded the effects, acting and script, so I won\\'t go into that too much here. What I will say is it was the best looking movie I have ever seen. Everything looked lived in. The fight scenes were choreographed masterfully. Each actor gave outstanding performances. Hans Zimmer gives a mesmerizing soundtrack.Frank Herbert\\'s vision was honored masterfully. Well done Denis Villeneuve.', \"Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey, and I was completely blown away. From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored, which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film.I don't want to write too much here, I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately. It doesn't release worldwide until March 1st, so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible. Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras.This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar's for sound editing, picture, etc., and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically. Like I stated in the beginning, see this film!\", 'I just watched this in IMAX and it was one of the greatest movie experiences I have ever had. Everything from part one was done even better in part two and the story was much more interesting. The outfits were so unique and really well made. Whenever I thought it was starting to move a little slow something insane happens and I\\'m instantly drawn back into the world of dune that Denis has remade and expanded on so much. All the shots of the different worlds were just breathtaking. The last hour of the movie is by far some of the best made cinema in awhile and the action was so good. The last fight was awesome as well. \"You fought well Atreides.\"', \"This movie more than accomplished all of the promises it set out, absolutely mesmerizing experience. I loved the first movie and thought it would be an impossibly difficult task to surpass it, but Denis Villeneuve has once again proven himself as the most promising sci-fi director of this age. I find that this installment of the series picks up its pace quickly and reaches its peak near the end of the film. Contrary to the first film where most of the action was packed into the middle. Dune: Part Two displays a more relaxed tone from the start to the middle of the movie, however the mood shifts to match the occasion and finally leaves you somewhat distraught as the consequences of the character's choices surely lead to a path they cannot return from. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is once again fantastic the mixture of his naturalistic style and the sci-fi genre leads to a grounded universe while still retaining the wonderous and whimsical aspects of science fiction, each decision on how planets and characters are portrayed demonstrates the care and attention paid to how audiences interpret them, you understand the Harkonnen, the Emperor, the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit and the remnants of house Atreides in one look at the way they are shown. The score is once again sublime, Hans Zimmer once again proves himself as the definitive motion picture composer, his ability to craft larger-than-life scores with his ability to understand the differences between each character and culture present in this film is nothing short of perfection, recurring themes and motifs are present throughout the movie and paired with the visuals and the performances, which are also incredible, form a modern day masterpiece crafted meticulously by masters of their respective fields. Rebecca Ferguson, Timothée Chalamet, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler and Zendaya give wonderful performances, with the first three being standouts. Overall this movie deserves the universal praise it has received and might just interest those who didn't even enjoy the first installment of the series.\", \"In the quiet embrace of ink and page, a story unfolded, timeless and sage, through the lens of a filmmaker's artistry, its essence soared, a masterpiece for all to see, i think Denis Villeneuve has just made the most visually stunning epic story of a movie that's ever been made, the most powerful story of a movie ever been told in the last 20 years, there has been no movies with this scale resulting in not just a piece of a film no more but a piece of art, it's what Infinity War and Endgame looks like if it's not a superhero for kids entertainment type movie, the more adult version of Star Wars, Dune has just become the most intriguing, fascinating, and admirable movie world that we should always get excited about right now, Marvel universe are over, Star Wars universe are over, let the maestro Denis Villeneuve handle all of this if they are gonna make another one, i'm glad to be able to say that i think Dune: Part Two was a Masterpiece, i haven't felt this awe feeling and just pure fascinated at a movie like this in quite a long time, i have nothing to complain about the story and the visual of the film because i felt most of it if not all of it was just perfect, i cannot describe how incredible the visual of the film was, how mesmerizing the sound and the score of the film was, and how amazing all of the performance was, props to Timothée Chalamet, i'm not surprise if he gets the nomination for best actor for the Oscars next year, he totally deserve it and absolutely needs to be considered, each dialogue was great, each scene from one to another felt important and worth it, action scenes are some of the best i've seen in a while, and the perfect stabilisation between the action and the narration scene are very well done, 2 hours and 47 minutes of pure grand epic film fills with the most stunning visual that you could possibly imagine, and an intriguing story telling that kept you going for the whole duration, it's that good, it's that epic, it's that great, Mastering others is strength, mastering yourself is true power, overall i could see both Denis Villeneuve Dune finally get the influential recognition 10 years from now, and specifically Part Two being also one of the greatest sequel ever made, Dune: Part Two was easily the best films of the year so far, it is more than what he supposed to deliver.\", 'Dune: Part Two is simply Denis Villeneuve\\'s Magnum Opus in his filmography. I\\'ve loved this director\\'s work since \"Blade Runner 2049\", and \"Arrival\". He did an excellent job placing his vision on the first Dune, but here, Villeneuve cranks his direction times 10!The structure, set-up, visuals, sound and story are crafted in ways that are hard for me to put in words, due to how everything came together so miraculously. The acting is also top-notch! Timothée Chalamet in particular is unbelievably phenomenal, and Zendaya does a great job as well. Austin Butler, Rebecca Ferguson and Florence Pugh are also excellent! Denis never lets you out of this experience! The pure weight of the film is presented through astounding narratives, rich cinematography, an epic story and mesmerizing action sequences that will make your seat rumble if you watch this on the big screen!There are quite a handful of thrilling moments that I still have no idea how they came out THIS good in the end! Denis Villeneuve is truly a sorcerer in the Sci-Fi genre! Every frame and detail in his films are captivating as hell, and it\\'s no different here in the slightest!Dune: Part Two made me leave the theater feeling inspired! There\\'s so much to take away from this masterpiece! Definitely my #1 favorite movie of this year as of now! Bring on Dune: Part Three as fast as possible!', \"After watching the advanced screening, we were blown away by Part 2 of Dune. It continues seamlessly after Part 1, with the same masterful soundtracks, action scenes and acting.The movie flew by despite it being almost three hours. The pacing was incredibly well done and nothing felt too fast or too slow.The CGI was incredibly realistic and the characters were portrayed so well by the lead actors. The chemistry between the characters felt so real - nothing felt fake or forced.It's truly difficult finding a movie that contains everything - flawless screenplay, writing, sound, acting and pacing, but Dune 2 does it all.One of the best movies of 2024 for sure.\", \"Dune Part 2 is an epic movie; slickly made, and visually stunning.But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book, especially the water of life scene and the final battle.The movie had almost a 3 hour run time, but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance.It is a beautiful movie, but it feels like it has no soul. The emotional connection between Paul and Chani, so vital to the story, is completely lacking and unbelievable. The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen.I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things, but she has basically 2 facial expressions here, and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul. I found her to be the worst part of this movie.The final fight scene is short, choppy, and a mess. It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling\\nThe Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish. The ending was super abrupt, and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel.I want to reiterate that this isn't a bad movie. Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing, but he can't give life to individual characters.It is like he can't see the trees for the forest.\", \"Both films are pretty consistent in the sense of, they both look amazing. The sound and score is top tier (Hans Zimmer). The action sequences ARE good when they actually happen (which is not very often.) The actors are all good actors. But they're both just straight up boring films to the core.I don't understand how people write reviews calling it 'masterpiece' or 'the peak of film making.' I just don't believe they could actually be entertained by the straight up DEAD story and DEAD dialogue for what seemed for the whole movie. The only piece of dialogue I actually remember being somewhat entertaining was when Timothy Chalamet said to Josh Brolin 'I recognise your footsteps.' I'm not missing anything, I'm sure. It was just...nothing. I couldn't wait for it to end.It just seems to me people are lying because they want to 'seem' smart because this was an acclaimed novel and had been made into a movie before in the past. Or they're just Timothy Chalamet groupies (I'm a big fan of him as an actor in his other work) and just want him to do well. I refuse to believe anyone found the plot of this movie good (thus making it entertaining) and it's not like it made up for the lack of story with amazing story telling through action like Mad Max Fury Road did. Can anyone think of any other reasons why people would really rate this movie even close to a 10/10?\", \"This movie is a visual masterpiece that will be studied for decades. The colors are vivid, the lighting is gorgeous and the cgi is mostly indistinguishable from reality.That said, despite being almost 3 hours long, the story felt hugely condensed. It felt like each scene gives you the bare minimum to understand what's happening, but elaborates on nothing. It felt like it wants you to immerse yourself in a unique and complex world, but gives every setting only a few minutes of time before hopping straight to the next. For example, the training of Paul. We never see him learn how to ride the sandworm, so when he succeeds, it doesn't feel as triumphant as it would have otherwise. The Harkonnens are also much less intimidating than they were before. Most of their screentime is comprised of them trying and failing to farm spice on Arrakis, until they are defeated by Paul and the Fremen at the end without much difficulty. They should have put up more of a fight. Lastly, I know from sources that an ecological message the was very important in the book was emmited completely from the film. The Fremen speak of bringing green back to Arrakis, but that's all we ever see them do.Part of it may be a limitation of the format. If one must adapt a book full of complex lore, than either a trilogy or even a serialization may be the better option as you get more time to explain everything. I know that a third film is coming but it's not based on the same book anymore, and while I haven't read any of the books, I don't believe I should. I believe that film should stand on its own two feet, and this one does. Its legs are long and slender, with just the bare minimum of muscle required to stand, but it stands nonethelss :)\", \"Paul has to prove himself to both Chani and The Fremen, his dreams become more vivid, one path leads to destruction, maybe even the loss of Chani.I don't think I've anticipated a film quite so much as this, since being spellbound by the first, I counted down the days for this follow up, and by chance got to see it a day early.In one single word, captivating, the best film I've seen in a very long time, absolutely wonderful from start to finish, the character development, visuals, music, action sequences are all tremendous.We get to see Paul growing before our very eyes, the character at the end of the film is very different to the one at the start, the best yet from Chalamet, he shows a degree of grit.A special mention about the performance of Austin Butler, I thought he was incredibly good as Feyd Rauth, what a menacing villain, one of those that had you wondering about what he'd do next, and that makeup, awesome.I can't fault a single performance, inspired casting, backed up by a marvellous script.The music is spot on once again, I instantly wanted to download Ripples in The sand and Paul's Dream once again.Incredible visuals, from the amazing location work, to the creative camera work, and the jaw dropping special effects.I thought this was going to be the toughest movie of the franchise, as so much happens at the start and the finish, it wasn't the case, this was a fabulous movie.10/10.\"]\n"
